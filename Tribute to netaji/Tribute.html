                    Subhas Chandra Bose (born c. January 23, 1897, Cuttack, Orissa [now Odisha], India—died August 18,
                    1945, Taipei, Taiwan?) was an Indian revolutionary prominent in the independence movement against
                    British rule of India. He also led an Indian national force from abroad against the Western powers
                    during World War II. He was a contemporary of Mohandas K. Gandhi, at times an ally and at other
                    times an adversary. Bose was known in particular for his militant approach to independence and for
                    his push for socialist policies.
